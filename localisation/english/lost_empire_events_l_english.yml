 lost_empire.1001.name:0 "The Fall of an Ascendancy"
 lost_empire.1001.desc:0 "Today marks the beginning of a new era.\n\n§H[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]§! has renounced our ascendancy to the rest of the galaxy, making it known to others that we have no further interest to expand our sphere of influence. The §H[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! have finally achieved their goals, and shaped the galaxy in their image. Without a doubt, the §H[Root.GetName]§! has left a stunning legacy for all younger races to see. Future generations will look back to this moment as a significant turning point in our history, when our civilization transcends geopolitics and expansion, and take a step back to reflect if we had always acted in the best interest of these young empires.\n\nPerhaps, these younger empires will one day find their own path and their meaning of existence without a center (like us) to hold them. And maybe that is for the best. Only time will tell."

 lost_empire.1002.name:0 "The Fall of §H[Banished.GetName]§!"
 lost_empire.1002.desc:0 "Our Empire has fallen. When the fleets of §H[Banisher.GetName]§! bombarded our core worlds and captured our leaders, our great civilization was brought to its knees. The barbarism of §H[Banisher.GetName]§! and their wanton use of weapons of mass destruction meant that many §H[Banished.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! did not make it through this bloody conflict.\n\nWhen a peace treaty was signed by our now humiliated government, the §H[Banisher.GetName]§! demanded huge sums for war reparations, an amount so ridiculous that it was outright impossible for us to pay. As if that wasn't enough, the §H[Banisher.GetSpeciesAdj]§! soldiers then helped themselves and took everything from our treasuries. Every scrap of food has been taken from the hands of our people as repayment for the war.\n\nIn addition to arms restrictions, the treaty also dictated that the §H[Banished.GetName]§! is forbidden to return to galactic affairs, or influence younger races in any way. The economic disaster brought on by the war and then the treaty led to unprecedented public anger against the current government."
