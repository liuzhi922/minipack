It was not surprising that she was often referred to as '§HThe Outlander§!'. '§HThe Outlander§!' soon grasped the basics of Dark Matter technology and was tasked with developing this project.

His afflictions however, seemed to stem from his love for a xeno. Mating with other species is considered perverse and highly unacceptable by his bigoted society. As the years gone by, the §HWatcher§! distanced himself from his empire's xenophobic zeal, casually slipping design flaws in his weapons as some sort of protest.

On his sick bed, '§HDoctor Divine§!' created his last weapon, the Portal Generator, to bring his 'love' from the other side.

Despite suffering from severe depression and homesickness, '§HThe Outlander§!' helped study the concept art stolen from a certain '§HDoctor Divine§!', and deemed this spiritualist's weapon not yet operational. The Dimensional Beam was then conceptualised to counter potential extradimensional invaders that the spiritualists would unleash on the galaxy. Fortunately for the materialists, their rival never completed the weapon and so the Dimensional Beam project was dropped.

Mainstream media was furious, wasting no time to slander the §HWatcher§!'s name and tendencies. The precursor empire never found their missing scientist and wherever possible, attempted to attribute the §HWatcher§!'s inventions to other scientists of 'purer hearts'.

We still have no idea why the Contingency wanted to build this specific weapon, or where they might have obtained such designs.
